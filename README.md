# Resolving the complex *Bordetella pertussis* genome using barcoded nanopore sequencing

This page is currently a work-in-progress (mostly due to data upload speed!), but will include:
- our full methodology, including any homemade code and commands used for community-built tools, plus a shell script to run either of our final pipelines
- links to our data repository, including raw and processed reads, and genome assembly tests
- extended results and links to full metadata/supplementary files
- references and other recommended reading

This site was built using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/).
